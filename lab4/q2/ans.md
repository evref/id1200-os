### Hard Links
Both the file file1.txt and file2.txt has the inode number 10263164, it seems like a hard link between files allows them to share inode number. This also results in the two files sharing the same contents. If one of the files are changed, then so is the other. When file1.txt is removed (using the ```rm``` command), file2.txt remains with the same contents. When file2.txt is removed (using the same command), the system command ```unlinkat``` is the command used to "remove" the file in the OS. Deleting turns out to be unlinking. 

### Soft Links
The inode number of file3.txt is 10263175 while the inode number of file4.txt is 10263176, so we can conclude that soft links does not make the two files share inode numbers. The two files share the same contents, and when one is edited: so is the other. After file3.txt has been deleted it is no longer possible to open file4.txt, as a result we are unable edit the file as well. The error I receive in my IDE when trying to open the file is ```The editor could not open because the file was not found```, which is reasonable as a soft link links to the file name of the original file. A similar error is received when trying to print out the contents of file4.txt using the ```cat``` command: ```No such file or directory```.
